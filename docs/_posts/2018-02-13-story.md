### The story

Panix is a basic operating system I am designing for my own, personal education. After taking CS-3310 (Operating Systems) at my university, I thought it would be a good idea to try to write my own.
I am doing this through the use of various tutorials, websites like OSDev.org, and my own knowledge of C++ and OS structures.
