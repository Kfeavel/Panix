# Panix
Panix is a basic operating system I am designing through the use of various tutorials, etc.</br>
After taking CS-3310 (Operating Systems) at my university, I thought it would be a good idea to try to write my own.

### Pronunciation
Panix is pronounced '/ˈpænɪks/' (as in the word 'panics') and is used to describe how I'll inevitably feel when I have to submit it for grading when it does indeed panic on boot.

### Installation
Currently Panix runs off of the pre-compiled .iso file provided in the repository.</br>
All testing is done in Virtualbox 5 with the following settings:
  - OS Type: Other/Unknown (32-bit)
  - Memory: 64 MB
  - Boot Medium: ISO (no HDD)
  - All other settings are set to the default for the OS Type

### Next Step(s)
  - Fix interrupts
  - ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
