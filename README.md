# EDIX
EDIX is a basic operating system I am designing through the use of various tutorials, etc.</br>
After taking CS-3310 (Operating Systems) at my university, I thought it would be a good idea to try to write my own.

### What does EDIX stand for?
Just as UNIX used to be UNICS (Uniplexed Information Computing System), EDIX is properly EDICS (Educational Information Computing System).</br>
The name is "shortened" to EDIX to stick with the long established *nix naming convention.
