# EDIX
EDIX (pronounced "edd-eks" | "edd-iks") is a basic operating system I am designing through the use of various tutorials, etc.</br>
After taking CS-3310 (Operating Systems) at my university, I thought it would be a good idea to try to write my own.

### What does EDIX stand for?
Just as UNIX used to be UNICS (Uniplexed Information Computing System), EDIX is properly EDICS (Educational Information Computing System).</br>
The name is "shortened" to EDIX to stick with the long established *nix naming convention.

### Installation
Currently EDIX runs off of the pre-compiled .iso file provided in the repository.</br>
All testing is done in Virtualbox 5 with the following settings:
  - OS Type: Other/Unknown (32-bit)
  - Memory: 64 MB
  - Boot Medium: ISO (no HDD)
  - All other settings are set to the default for the OS Type

### TODO
  - Clean up file structure and move things to src/, obj/, build/, etc. respectively.
    - Modify Makefile to support this
  - Continue adding hardware integration (next step: keyboard)
  - ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
