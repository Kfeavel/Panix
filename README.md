# - Notice -
Panix is currently undergoing many re-writes (3 complete rewrites within the past year!) in an attempt to find the right grounding since a solid foundation is absolutely crucial for a good OS. Since we're just students learning this as we go, we're discovering that some tutorials are better than others. As such, we've switched from the Github "Build an OS" tutorial to the WYOOS (Write Your Own OS) tutorial that Panix (back then, Edix) originally started following. To summarize, Panix development is still quite volitile, but we'll be settling down soon as we believe the WYOOS tutorials to provide a very strong foundation from which we can build off of.

# Panix
Panix is a basic operating system I am designing through the use of various tutorials, etc.</br>
After taking CS-3310 (Operating Systems) at my university, I thought it would be a good idea to try to write my own.

### Pronunciation
Panix is pronounced '/ˈpænɪks/' (as in the word 'panics') and is used to describe how I'll inevitably feel when I have to submit it for grading when it does indeed panic on boot.
