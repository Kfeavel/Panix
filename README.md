# Panix
Panix is a basic operating system I am designing through the use of various tutorials, etc.</br>
After taking CS-3310 (Operating Systems) at my university, I thought it would be a good idea to try to write my own.

### Pronunciation
Panix is pronounced '/ˈpænɪks/' (as in the word 'panics') and is used to describe how I'll inevitably feel when I have to submit it for grading when it does indeed panic on boot.
